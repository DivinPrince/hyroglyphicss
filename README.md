# hyroglyphicss

Style your html using emojis

- 💪 flex
- 🍆 flex-grow
- ⭕️ rounded-full
- 🙈 hidden
- and more...

## But why?

Tailwind classes often become too large and go off my monitor, but luckily emojis are plentiful and can be used for classes.

Buckle up boys, we've reached peak web development.

## How to Use

Install it

`npm i hyroglyphicss`

import it (yes, like in your `global.css` file you chad).
